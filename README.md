# Spam Email Classification using NLP and Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Spam Email Classification** project! This repository showcases a powerful implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to identify and classify spam emails effectively.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
Spam emails are a universal nuisance, but with the right tools, they can be managed effectively. This project aims to:

- Process and analyze email data using NLP.
- Implement machine learning algorithms to classify emails as spam or non-spam.
- Demonstrate the use of feature extraction techniques like Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF.

---

## 🎯 **Key Features**

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizing advanced text representation techniques like TF-IDF.
- **Model Building**: Training multiple machine learning models, including Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and others.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to gauge model performance.

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Core programming language for implementation.
- **NLP Libraries**: NLTK, scikit-learn for text preprocessing and analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms and models implemented with scikit-learn.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful data visualizations.
